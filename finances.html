      <h2>Average Bill Costs</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content2">
      <div class="text1">
        <p>In 2019, the average electricity bill in the US was $115 a month, or $1,380 a year, according to the Energy Information Administration. Additionally, R&M Climate Control estimates that a medium-sized, 40-gallon water heater that uses 4.5 kW and is active for two hours a day would cost around $426 a year. When previewing example renewable energy products, we will recall these prices to determine how long it would take to equalize the cost of renewable energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will explore 3 potential solutions and their approximate costs: solar water heating, solar energy systems, and wind energy systems.

      <h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <div class="text1">
        <p>Solar water heaters are one method of utilizing renewable energy. Hot water is essential for hot showers and heating homes. There are two main tyles of solar water heaters: active and passive. Although both systems use solar energy to heat water, active solar water heaters use pumps or other mechanical devices to circulate water, while passive solar water heaters take advantage of the lesser density of hot water to circulate hot water through the home.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Department of Energy, a solar water heater will cost between $5,000 to $7,000 to purchase and install. Therefore, by recalling that a medium-sized, 40-gallon water heater that uses 4.5 kW and is active for two hours a day would cost around $426 a year, we can determine that an average solar water heater will take around 14 years to equalize the cost of renewable energy.

      <h2>Solar Energy Systems</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <div class="text1">
        <p>Solar photovoltaic systems are more traditional in approach, as they involve installing regular solar panels to a roof or a nearby surface. Depending on budget and location, any varying amount of solar panels can be installed within reason. The benefit of using solar panels are that they are highly reliable and require little maintenance, according to the Department of Energy. Furthermore, there can be varying levels of efficiency, such as installing tracking devices to orient the solar panels for maximum sunlight capture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solar photovoltaic systems cost about $3 per watt installed. Since the average energy consumption of a home is about 29 kilowatts per day, a 7,000 watt system would cover most if not all of a home's energy usage and would cost about $21,000 to install. If an average electricity bill was $1,380 a year, a solar photovoltaic system would pay off in a little more than 15 years.

      <h2>Wind Energy Systems</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <div class="text1">
        <p>Perchance the most situational solution on this list, wind power needs a consistent breeze to be a reliable source of renewable energy for a home. According to the Department of Energy, a homeowner should have at least one acre of land and live in an area that has an average annual wind speed of at least 10 miles per hour. Furthermore, wind energy systems can be somewhat obstructive, as they tower over typical homes and establishments to achieve a level of efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small wind energy system can cost between $10,000 to $70,000 to purchase and install. Again, if an average electricity bill was $1,380 a year, a wind energy system would pay off in around 29 years.

      <h2>Selling Energy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <div class="text1">
        <p>Due to the long times to pay off a renewable energy system, it could be daunting for prospective users to consider renewable energy. However, there are ways to minimize the cost of renewable energy. One prominent way is to <a href="practices.html" style="color: #7dca98; text-decoration: none;">reduce energy usage</a> in the house. One other method is to sell excess energy. If a homeowner's renewable energy system generated more energy than was used, they could sell the excess energy to their utility providers and help pay back their renewable energy investments more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>To encourage US citizens in investing in renewable energy, the IRS introduced a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit" style="color: #7dca98; text-decoration: none;">tax rebate system</a> to provide credit for any renewable energy investment for a residental home. This tax rebate promises 30% of the "costs of new, qualified clean energy property" for a home installed from 2022-2032.
